# Eli's Mod
a Minecraft mod for 1.20.1 adding nerd stuff to the game

# Quick Setup
Go to 'Releases', locate elismod-1.x.x.jar, and install how you would any other Forge mod. Done!

# Setup for Source Code Viewing
This is mainly guided for IntelliJ users, although other IDEs likely cause no issue.
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.)
3. Navigate to File/Project Structure and ensure usage of **Java JDK 17**

In your Gradle tasks tab, navigate to the "forgegradle runs" folder. You'll see two main tasks: runData and runClient.
- runData is used for data generation regarding block JSON files
- runClient is used for opening an instance of Minecraft with the mod pre-lodaed

- # Run
Run the runClient task. That's it!
